Is the nation-state being undermined?\" (Robinson 2007:127) Relatedly, to what extent is the relationship between social structure and territoriality being redefined by globalization? Is there a deterritorialization of social relations under globalization? What is the relationship between the local and the global? How are space and time being reconfigured?

Is there a deterritorialization of social\" (Robinson 2007:127) \"relations under globalization? What is the relationship between the local and the global? How are space and time being reconfigured?\" (Robinson 2007:128) \"THE NETWORK SOCIETY Manuel Castells' groundbreaking trilogy, The Rise of the Network Society (1996, 1997, 1998), exemplifies a 'technologistic' approach to globalization\" (Robinson 2007:132) \"'communication decisively shapes culture because we do not see . . . reality as it 'is' but as our languages are'.
