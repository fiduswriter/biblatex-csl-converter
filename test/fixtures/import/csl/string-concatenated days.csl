It implements supervision and execution capabilities, combined with different planning techniques: -- plan synthesis to complement existing operational plans; and -- anticipation planning to advise the execution for the best option to take when facing choices (by anticipating plans execution), and to forecast problems that may arise due to unforeseen situations.",
