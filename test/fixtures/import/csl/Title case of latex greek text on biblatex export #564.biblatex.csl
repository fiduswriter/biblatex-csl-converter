Consequently, the designations 'the altar' and 'the worshippers' serve to clarify precisely who are the recipients of God's sovereign protection — entailed in the act of 'measuring the temple of God'. It is further contended that these designations serve to distinguish between two groups within the community of the righteous: i.e., those who are martyred ('the altar') and those who simply remain faithful to the end ('the worshippers').",
