  abstract = {This paper is devoted to a new regularization method for solving the  numerical analytic continuation of an analytic function f(z) = f(x +  iy) on a strip domain Omega(+) = \{z = x + iy is an element of C  vertical bar x is an element of R, 0 \vphantom\}$<$ y $<$ y(0)\vphantom\{\}, where the data is  given approximately only on the line y = 0. This problem is severely  ill-posed and has important practical applications. The theoretical  optimal error bound for the problem is proved which is independent of  the selected regularization methods. A modified Tikhonov regularization  method with asymptotic order optimal error estimates is proposed. This  method can be numerically implemented easily by the fast Fourier  transform. Some numerical examples are provided and a comparison with a  Fourier regularization method is given, which show the modified  Tikhonov method works very well.},
