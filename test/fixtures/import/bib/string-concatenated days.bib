  abstract =     "In this paper, we investigate the links between
                 planning and plans execution. We propose a new approach
                 (Propice-Plan) which integrates both activities. It
                 implements supervision and execution capabilities,
                 combined with different planning techniques: -- plan
                 synthesis to complement existing operational plans; and
                 -- anticipation planning to advise the execution for
                 the best option to take when facing choices (by
                 anticipating plans execution), and to forecast problems
                 that may arise due to unforeseen situations.",
