        "abstract": "It is a well-known but little-studied fact that evaluativeadverbs - adverbs indicating the attitude of the speaker towards theinformation she is conveying - can modify degree ('incredibly tall','ridiculously expensive'...). This thesis offers a syntactosemanticaccount of evaluative degree modi fication of both gradable adjectivesand gradable nouns.Following Morzycki (2004), I propose that evaluative degreemodi fication involves a covert operator (which I will call EVAL);however, my proposal differs from that of Morzycki in several crucialrespects. Most importantly, I argue that evaluative degreeconstructions should not be analysed as embedded exclamatives.Furthermore, I show how their syntactic behaviour illuminates theirsemantic composition, using evidence from different phenomena in bothEnglish and Dutch.Subsequently, I examine the linguistic evidence for the gradability ofcertain nouns, like 'idiot', 'nerd', 'genius', 'Barbie dollenthusiast', and 'weirdo', and conclude that they, like gradableadjectives, have a degree argument. I show how this class of gradablenouns may be defined in prototype-theoretic terms. Morzycki (2009)has shown that gradable nouns can be modified by size adjectives like'big' and 'enormous'; I extend his account by including degreemodification by evaluative adjectives.Finally, several suggestions for further research are offered.",
