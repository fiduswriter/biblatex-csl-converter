abstract = {Cluster model calculations have been carried out to study the electronic state {and} the chemical bonding in Cu2O {and} CuO as well as YBa2Cu3O7 {and} YBa2Cu3O6. The clusters used are Cu4O14-9, Cu4O16-12, Cu3O17-12 {and} Cu3O15-10, respectively, each being embedded in an appropriate electrostatic potential reflecting the crystal structure. The covalent interaction between Cu {and} O is most significant in the cluster for the high-temperature superconductor YBa2CuO7. It is remarkable that O 2p[pi] holes are created near the Fermi level {and} stabilized in the O----Cu+---O- linear bond formed in the basal Cu2O plane of the cluster for YBa2Cu3O7. A charge disproportionation takes place both in the model clusters for YBa2Cu3O7 {and} YBa2Cu3O6, while a spin polarization is seen only in the latter. The similarity {and} dissimilarity of Cu atoms in those oxides are discussed.},
