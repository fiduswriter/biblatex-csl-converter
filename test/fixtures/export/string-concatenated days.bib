abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the links between planning {and} plans execution. We propose a new approach (Propice-Plan) which integrates both activities. It implements supervision {and} execution capabilities, combined with different planning techniques: -- plan synthesis to complement existing operational plans; {and} -- anticipation planning to advise the execution for the best option to take when facing choices (by anticipating plans execution), {and} to forecast problems that may arise due to unforeseen situations.},
