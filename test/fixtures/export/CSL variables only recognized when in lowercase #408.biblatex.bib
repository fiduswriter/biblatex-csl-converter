abstract = {A counting Bloom filter (CBF) generalizes a Bloom filter data structure so as to allow membership queries on a set that can be changing dynamically via insertions {and} deletions. As with a Bloom filter, a CBF obtains space savings by allowing false positives. We provide a simple hashing-based alternative based on d-left hashing called a d-left CBF (dlCBF). The dlCBF offers the same functionality as a CBF, but uses less space, generally saving a factor of two or more. We describe the construction of dlCBFs, provide an analysis, {and} demonstrate their effectiveness experimentally.},
