We show that Lang's conjecture holds (one direction only): X and all its subvarieties are of general type and the canonical divisor K_X is ample at smooth points and Kawamata log terminal points of X, provided that K_X is Q-Cartier, no Calabi-Yau variety is algebraic Lang hyperbolic and a weak abundance conjecture holds.",
