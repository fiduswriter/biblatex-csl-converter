abstract = {Let X be a projective variety which is algebraic Lang hyperbolic. We show that Lang's conjecture holds (one direction only): X {and} all its subvarieties are of general type {and} the canonical divisor K{\_}X is ample at smooth points {and} Kawamata log terminal points of X, provided that K{\_}X is Q-Cartier, no Calabi-Yau variety is algebraic Lang hyperbolic {and} a weak abundance conjecture holds.},
