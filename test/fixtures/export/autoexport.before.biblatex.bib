abstract = {We study the energy used by a production-level regional climate {and} weather simulation code on a distributed memory system with hybrid CPU-GPU nodes. The code is optimised for both processor architectures, for which we investigate both time {and} energy to solution. Operational constraints for time to solution can be met with both processor types, although on different numbers of nodes. Energy to solution is a factor 3 lower with GPUs, but strong scaling can be pushed to larger node counts with CPUs to minimize time to solution. Our data shows that an affine relationship exists between energy {and} nodehours consumed by the simulation. We use this property to devise a simple {and} practical methodology for optimising for energy efficiency that can be applied to other applications, which we demonstrate with the HPCG benchmark. We conclude with a discussion about the relationship to the commonly-used GF/Watt metric.},
