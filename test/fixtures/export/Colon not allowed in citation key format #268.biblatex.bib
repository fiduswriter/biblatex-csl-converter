abstract = {This history of the books of Reading Abbey covers the period from the abbey's foundation to its dissolution, {and} also charts the dispersal of the book collections up until c.1610. It provides valuable evidence for intellectual life {and} the use of books in a medieval monastery. By continuing the story beyond the Dissolution of the Monasteries, {and} charting the initial stages of the dispersal of the Abbey's books (many into the large institutional collections which are their homes today), Alan Coates makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of the fate of monastic books {and} book-collecting in the second half of the sixteenth century.},
